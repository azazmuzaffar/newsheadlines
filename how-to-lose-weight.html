                    <p class="contentDesc">If you want to lose your weight with in some days then 
                      you are at right place, Today i will tell you some tips or number of ways to lose weight with in days
                    and following are some number of ways:<br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>1. Do not skip breakfast</h3><br>
                    <img style="width: 820px;" class = "img-fluid" src="public/lose-weight/breakfast.jpeg" alt=""><br><br>
                    <p class="contentDesc">Skipping breakfast will not help you lose weight. You could miss out on
                       essential nutrients and you may end up
                       snacking more throughout the day because you feel hungry. and try to eat healthy things in breakfast like eggs, fruits, milk etc.</p>
                    
                       <h3>2. Eat regular meals</h3><br>
                       <img class = "img-fluid" src="public/lose-weight/regular-meals.jpg" alt="Image"><br><br>
                       <p class="contentDesc">Eating at regular times during the day helps burn calories at a faster rate. It also reduces the temptation to snack
                          on foods high in fat and sugar.Eating at regular times help your stomach to digest your food properly.</p>


                        <h3>3. Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables</h3><br>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="public/lose-weight/food-and-vegetables.jpg" alt="Image"><br><br>
                        <p class="contentDesc">Fruit and veg are low in calories and fat, and high in fibre – 3
                           essential ingredients for successful weight loss. They also contain 
                           plenty of vitamins and minerals.

                        </p>

                        
                        <h3>4. Get more active</h3>
                        <p class="contentDesc">Being active is key to losing weight and keeping it off. As well as providing lots of health benefits, exercise can help burn off the excess 
                          calories you cannot lose through diet alone.</p>

                          <h3>5. Drink plenty of water</h3><br>
                          <img class="img-fluid" src="public/lose-weight/water.jpg" alt="Water"><br><br>
                          <p class="contentDesc">Your body uses water in all its cells, organs, and tissues to help regulate
                             temperature and maintain other bodily functions. Because your body loses water through breathing,
                              sweating, and digestion, it's important to
                             rehydrate by drinking fluids and eating foods that contain water.</p>
                             <p class="contentDesc">People sometimes confuse thirst with hunger. You can end up consuming
                                extra calories when a
                                glass of water is really what you need.</p>
                                <br>

                               <h3>6. Eat high fibre foods</h3> 
                               <p class="contentDesc">Foods containing lots of fibre can help keep you feeling full, which is perfect
                                for losing weight. Fibre is only found in food from plants, such as fruit and veg, oats,
                                wholegrain bread, brown rice and pasta, and beans, peas and lentils.</p>

                                <br>
                                <h3>7. Read food labels</h3>
                                <p class="contentDesc">Knowing how to read food labels can help you choose healthier options. Use the calorie 
                                  information to work out how a particular food fits into your daily
                                   calorie allowance on the weight loss plan.</p>
                                   <br>

                                  <h3>8. Use a smaller plate</h3>
                                  <p class="contentDesc">Using smaller plates can help you eat smaller portions. By using smaller plates and bowls,
                                    you may be able to gradually get used to eating smaller portions without going hungry. It
                                     takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it's full, so eat
                                    slowly and stop eating before you feel full.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <h3>9. Do not ban foods</h3>
                                    <p class="contentDesc">Do not ban any foods from your weight loss plan, especially the ones you like. 
                                      Banning foods will only make you crave them more. There's no reason you cannot enjoy the occasional
                                       treat as long as you stay within your daily calorie allowance.</p>
                                       <br>

                                      <h3>10. Do not stock junk food</h3>
                                      <p class="contentDesc">To avoid temptation, do not stock junk food – such as chocolate, biscuits, crisps and 
                                        sweet fizzy drinks – at home. Instead, opt for healthy snacks, such as fruit, unsalted rice cakes,
                                         oat cakes, unsalted or unsweetened popcorn, and fruit juice.</p>

                                         <br>
                                         <h3>11. Cut down on alcohol </h3>
                                         <p class="contentDesc">
                                          A standard glass of wine can contain as many calories as a piece of chocolate. Over 
                                          time, drinking too
                                           much can easily contribute to weight gain.
                                         </p><br>

                                         <h3>12. Plan your meals</h3>
                                         <p class="contentDesc">
                                          Try to plan your breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks for the week, making sure you stick
                                          to your calorie allowance. You may find
                                          it helpful to make a weekly shopping list.
                                         </p>

                                         <br>
